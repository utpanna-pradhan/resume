        <p>Air Quality Index (AQI) helps in explaining how to plan activities around air quality and help us live the healthiest
        lives possible. Hence, learning to read and interpret the AQI is the first step in engaging with our health and air
        qualityAQI assesses individual air pollutant level in the ambient air. Interpreting AQI may sound complicated, but when
        broken down it really is quite simple. AQI communicates the air quality in terms of number from 1 to 500. The higher the
        number, the greater the health risks associated with the air quality. When the level of air pollution is very high, the
        number will be reported above 300.
        
        
        Ideally, when the air quality is good, the AQI is low (0-50), and the color associated with it is green. As the air
        quality worsens, the number gets higher, and the color associated with it becomes a darker shade of red.
